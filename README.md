## Function Overview
This calculator has the following main functions:
1. **Basic Operations**: Supports basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Decimal Handling**: Can handle the input and calculation of numbers containing decimal points.
3. **Number Input**: Users can input numbers by clicking the number buttons on the interface.
4. **Clear Operations**: Provides functions to clear all input, clear the current input, and delete the last digit.
5. **System Color Adaptation**: Can automatically adjust the interface color according to the system's theme color (dark or light).

## Interface Description
### Color Mode
The calculator will automatically switch the interface color according to the system's color theme. If the system is in dark mode, the calculator will adopt a dark color scheme; if it is in light mode, it will use a light color scheme.

### Display Area
- **Current Display**: Used to display the numbers entered by the user and the calculation results. The maximum display length is 10 digits.

### Button Area
- **Number Buttons**: From 0 to 9, used for entering numbers.
- **Decimal Point Button**: Used for entering decimal points.
- **Operator Buttons**: Including operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (ร), and division (รท), used for performing mathematical operations.
- **Clear Buttons**:
  - **Clear All**: Clears all input and calculation results, and resets the display area to 0.
  - **Clear Current**: Clears the currently entered number.
  - **Delete One**: Deletes the last digit in the display area.

## Usage Method
### Number Input
Click the number buttons (0 - 9) to enter numbers. If you need to enter a decimal number, you can click the decimal point button.

### Basic Operations
After entering the first number, click the operator button to select the operation to be performed, then enter the second number, and finally click the equal sign (=) button to perform the calculation. The calculation result will be displayed in the display area.

### Clear Operations
- If you want to clear all input and calculation results, click the "Clear All" button.
- If you only want to clear the currently entered number, click the "Clear Current" button.
- If you want to delete the last digit in the display area, click the "Delete One" button.

## Technical Details
### Dependent Libraries
This calculator uses the following Python libraries:
- `math`: Used for mathematical calculations.
- `tkinter`: Used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- `cmath`: Used for complex number calculations.
- `fractions`: Used for fraction handling.
- `decimal`: Used for high-precision decimal calculations.
- `threading`: Used for starting a thread to check the system color.
- `time`: Used for time-related operations.
- `darkdetect`: Used for detecting the system's color theme (dark or light).

### Code Structure
- `add_fraction`: Used to handle the addition operation of fractions.
- `calculate_expression`: Used to calculate the entered expression.
- `Int`: Used for integer conversion.
- `pressNumber`: Handles the click event of the number buttons.
- `pressDP`: Handles the click event of the decimal point button.
- `clearAll`: Clears all input and calculation results.
- `clearCurrent`: Clears the currently entered number.
- `delOne`: Deletes the last digit in the display area.
- `modifyResult`: Modifies the calculation result.
- `pressOperator`: Handles the click event of the operator buttons.
- `Demo`: Used for demonstration.
- `check_system_color`: Starts a thread to check the system's color theme and adjusts the interface color according to the result.

## Citation Instructions
